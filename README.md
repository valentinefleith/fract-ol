# fract-ol

This project is about creating fractals graphically.

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based
it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern
remains the same at every scale.

This projects uses the 42 school graphical library: the MiniLibX. This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
